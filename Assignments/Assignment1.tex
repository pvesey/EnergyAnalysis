\section*{Assignment Outline}


In this assignment you are going to explore the solar energy opportunities for
the a small holiday house. You have been provided with a Revit file of the
house design. For this assignment you are required to:


\begin{enumerate}

	\item Set the geolocation and orientation of the house according to the table below
	\item Create an interior solar animation in the living room for the summer solstice. (One day, 15 min interval)
	\item Create an interior solar animation in the living room for the winter solstice. (One day, 15 min interval)
	\item Create an exterior solar animation for the summer solstice. (One day, 15 min interval)
	\item Create an exterior solar animation for the winter solstice. (One day, 15 min interval)
	\item Create an Insight using Insight 360.
	\item Using Insight 360, create a Lighting Analysis for all Levels.
	\item Using Insight 360, create a Solar Analysis for the roof and indicate the optimum location for solar thermal panels. Present the Cumulative Insolation, Peak Insolation, and Average Insolation on an A1 Revit sheet. Use 	annotation to indicate your proposed solar panel location.
	\item Using the building elements, create an analysis in Green Building Studio. Comment on the results in a 2 page report.
\end{enumerate}
